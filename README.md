# UOMI-AUTOMATIC

`UOMI-AUTOMATIC` is a Python script designed to automate interactions on the Uomi testnet. This script allows you to easily perform token swaps and add liquidity to pools in bulk, with a simple and quick configuration.

## Key Features
* **Automated Swaps**: Performs random token swaps from UOMI to USDC, SYN, or SIM.
* **Automated Liquidity Provision**: Adds liquidity to various supported token pools.
* **Practical Configuration**: Retrieves private keys from a `.env` file and a list of proxies from `proxies.txt`.
* **Simple Interface**: After running the script, you only need to input the number of swaps, number of liquidity additions, and the token amount.
* **Transaction Log**: Displays the status, transaction hash, and explorer link for every successful transaction.


To run this script, you need to install several Python libraries.

3.  Install libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install web3 aiohttp aiohttp-socks colorama pytz python-dotenv
    ```

## Prepare Configuration Files
Make sure you have the following files in the same folder as the `main.py` script:
* `main.py`: The main script for the bot.
* `.env`: This file stores your account private keys. Use a format like this:
    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY_1=your_private_key_1
    PRIVATE_KEY_2=your_private_key_2
    # ... and add more if you want
    ```
* `proxies.txt`: (Optional) This file contains your list of proxies, one proxy per line.

## How to Use
1.  Open your terminal in the script directory.
2.  Run the script with the following command:
